Hi, I’m Ridham Sharma. I have a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and hands-on experience using Python and JS languages to create and implement software applications.
I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as it keeps me to learn new languages and development techniques. 
Currently I am working on a ReactJS or MERN based applications but my interests spans from Machine Learning to Quantum Computing.

I have learned a lot about technologies primarily focusing on Web Development. I enjoy everything that I do. I am always ready to face challenges and get along with people very well.
I believe in vision and action. I learn from my mistakes. I am ready to take any challenge required to perform my job.
I also look forward to adding value to the community with what I do.
